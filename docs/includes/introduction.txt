Faust is a Python library for event processing and streaming applications
that are distributed and fault-tolerant.

It's inspired by tools such as `Kafka Streams`_, `Apache Spark`_,
`Apache Storm`_, `Apache Samza`_ and `Apache Flink`_; but takes
a radically much simpler approach to stream processing.

Modern web applications are increasingly being written as a collection
of microservices and even before this it has been difficult to write
data reporting operations at scale.  In a reactive stream based system,
you don't have to strain your database with costly queries, instead a streaming
data pipeline updates information as events happen in your system, in real-time.

Faust also enables you to take advantage of asyncio and asynchronous
processing, moving complicated and costly operations outside
of the web server process: converting video, notifying third-party services,
etc. are common use cases for event processing.

You may not know it yet, but if you're writing a modern web application,
you probably already have a need for Faust.

Faust is...
==========================

**Simple**
    Faust is extremely easy to use compared to other stream processing
    solutions.  There's no DSL to limit your creativity, no restricted
    set of operations to work from, and since Faust is a library it can
    integrate with just about anything.

    Here's one of the simplest applications you can make::

        import faust

        class Greeting(faust.Record):
            from_name: str
            to_name: str

        app = faust.App('hello-app', url='kafka://localhost')
        topic = app.topic('hello-topic', value_type=Greeting)

        @app.agent(topic)
        async def hello(greetings):
            async for greeting in greetings:
                print(f'Hello from {greeting.from_name} to {greeting.to_name}')

        @app.timer(interval=1.0)
        async def example_sender(app):
            await hello.send(
                value=Greeting(from_name='Faust', to_name='you'),
            )

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.main()

    You're probably a bit intimidated by the `async` and `await` keywords,
    but you don't have to know how asyncio works to use
    Faust: just mimic the examples and you'll be fine.

    The example application starts two tasks: one is processing a stream,
    the other is a background thread sending events to that stream.
    In a real-live application your system will publish
    events to Kafka topics that your processors can consume from,
    and the background thread is only needed to feed data into our
    example.

**Highly Available**
    Faust is highly available and can survive network problems and server
    crashes.  In the case of node failure it can automatically recover,
    and tables have standby nodes that will take over.

**Distributed**
    Start more instances of your application as needed.

**Fast**
    Faust applications can hopefully handle millions of events per second
    in the future.

**Flexible**
    Faust is just Python, and a stream is just an infinite async iterator.
    If you know how to use Python, you already know how to use Faust,
    and it works with your favorite Python libraries like Django, Flask,
    SQLAlchemy, NTLK, NumPy, Scikit, TensorFlow, etc.
