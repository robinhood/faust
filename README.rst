Faust is a Python library for event processing and streaming applications
that are distributed and fault-tolerant.

It's inspired by tools such as `Kafka Streams`_, `Apache Spark`_,
`Apache Storm`_, `Apache Samza`_ and `Apache Flink`_; but takes
a radically much simpler approach to stream processing.

Modern web applications are increasingly being written as a collection
of microservices and even before this it has been difficult to write
data reporting operations at scale.  In a reactive stream based system,
you don't have to strain your database with costly queries, instead a streaming
data pipeline updates information as events happen in your system, in real-time.

Faust also enables you to take advantage of asyncio and asynchronous
processing, moving complicated and costly operations outside
of the web server process: converting video, notifying third-party services,
etc. are common use cases for event processing.

You may not know it yet, but if you're writing a modern web application,
you probably already have a need for Faust.

Faust is...
==========================

**Simple**
    Faust is extremely easy to use compared to other stream processing
    solutions.  There's no DSL to limit your creativity, no restricted
    set of operations to work from, and since Faust is a library it can
    integrate with just about anything.

    Here's one of the simplest applications you can make::

        import faust

        class Greeting(faust.Record):
            from_name: str
            to_name: str

        app = faust.App('hello-app', url='kafka://localhost')
        topic = app.topic('hello-topic', value_type=Greeting)

        @app.agent(topic)
        async def hello(greetings):
            async for greeting in greetings:
                print(f'Hello from {greeting.from_name} to {greeting.to_name}')

        @app.timer(interval=1.0)
        async def example_sender(app):
            await hello.send(
                value=Greeting(from_name='Faust', to_name='you'),
            )

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.main()

    You're probably a bit intimidated by the `async` and `await` keywords,
    but you don't have to know how asyncio works to use
    Faust: just mimic the examples and you'll be fine.

    The example application starts two tasks: one is processing a stream,
    the other is a background thread sending events to that stream.
    In a real-live application your system will publish
    events to Kafka topics that your processors can consume from,
    and the background thread is only needed to feed data into our
    example.

**Highly Available**
    Faust is highly available and can survive network problems and server
    crashes.  In the case of node failure it can automatically recover,
    and tables have standby nodes that will take over.

**Distributed**
    Start more instances of your application as needed.

**Fast**
    Faust applications can hopefully handle millions of events per second
    in the future.

**Flexible**
    Faust is just Python, and a stream is just an infinite async iterator.
    If you know how to use Python, you already know how to use Faust,
    and it works with your favorite Python libraries like Django, Flask,
    SQLAlchemy, NTLK, NumPy, Scikit, TensorFlow, etc.

Installation
============

You can install faust either via the Python Package Index (PyPI)
or from source.

To install using `pip`,::

    $ pip install -U faust

.. _installing-from-source:

Downloading and installing from source
--------------------------------------

Download the latest version of faust from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/faust

You can install it by doing the following,::

    $ tar xvfz faust-0.0.0.tar.gz
    $ cd faust-0.0.0
    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install

The last command must be executed as a privileged user if
you are not currently using a virtualenv.

FAQ
===

Can I use Faust with Django/Flask/etc.?
---------------------------------------

Yes! Use gevent/eventlet and use a bridge to integrate with asyncio.

- ``aiogevent`` enables you to run Faust on top of gevent:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/aiogevent

    Example::

        import aiogevent
        import asyncio
        asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(aiogevent.EventLoopPolicy())
        import gevent.monkey
        gevent.monkey.patch_all()
        # if you use PostgreSQL with psycopg, make sure you also
        # install psycogreen and call this pather:
        #  import psycogreen.gevent
        #  psycogreen.gevent.patch_psycopg()

        # Import Django/Flask etc, stuff and use them with Faust.

- ``aioeventlet`` enables you to run Faust on top of eventlet:

    http://aioeventlet.readthedocs.io

    Example::

        import aioeventlet
        import asyncio
        asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(aioeventlet.EventloopPolicy())
        import eventlet
        eventlet.monkey_patch()
        # if you use PostgreSQL with psycopg, make sure you also
        # install psycogreen and call this pather:
        #  import psycogreen.eventlet
        #  psycogreen.eventlet.patch_psycopg()

        # Import Django/Flask etc, stuff and use them with Faust.

Can I use Faust with Tornado?
-----------------------------

Yes! Use the ``tornado.platform.asyncio`` bridge:
http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/asyncio.html

Can I use Faust with Twisted?
-----------------------------

Yes! Use the asyncio reactor implementation:
https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/17.1.0/api/twisted.internet.asyncioreactor.html

Will you support Python 3.5 or earlier?
---------------------------------------

There are no immediate plans to support Python 3.5, but you are welcome to
contribute to the project.

Here are some of the steps required to accomplish this:

- Source code transformation to rewrite variable annotations to comments

  for example, the code::

        class Point:
            x: int = 0
            y: int = 0

   must be rewritten into::

        class Point:
            x = 0  # type: int
            y = 0  # type: int

- Source code transformation to rewrite async functions

    for example, the code::

        async def foo():
            await asyncio.sleep(1.0)

    must be rewritten into::

        @coroutine
        def foo():
            yield from asyncio.sleep(1.0)

Will you support Python 2?
--------------------------

There are no plans to support Python 2, but you are welcome to contribute to
the project (details in question above is relevant also for Python 2).
