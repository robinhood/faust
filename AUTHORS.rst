This Open Source project is run as a government where Vineet and Ask
are de-facto dictators for three years after first release. After
that it turns into a democracy where maintainers have the chance
to vote for new leadership.

We have monthly government meetings where we
collectively make decisions related to the projects future.
These meetings shall be fully transparent and the voice of everybody
will be heard and respected.

Contributors become committers by stepping up to the task.
They can 1) triage issues, help others on the issue tracker, code reviews,
Slack or mailing lists, or 2) make modifications to documentation and code.
The award for doing this in any significant capacity for one year or longer,
is to be added to the list of maintainers above.
