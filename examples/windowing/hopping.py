# In this exapmple we have a function `publish_every_2secs` publishing a
# message every 2 seconds to topic `hopping_topic`.
# We have created an agent `print_windowed_events` consuming events from
# `hopping_topic` that mutates the windowed table `hopping_table`.

# `hopping_table` is a table with hopping (overlaping) windows. Each of
# its windows is 10 seconds of duration, and we create a new window every 5
# seconds.

# Since we produce an event every 2 seconds and our windows are 10
# seconds of duration we expect different the following results per method
# called in `WindowWrapper`:
# - now(): Gets the closest value to current local time. It will always be
# between 1 and 3.
# - current(): Gets the value relative to the event's timestamp. It will
# always be between 1 and 3.
# - value(): Gets the value relative to default relative option. It will
# always be between 1 and 3.
# - delta(30): Gets the value of window 30 secs before the current event. For
# the first 20 seconds it will be 0 and after second 30 it will always be 5.
